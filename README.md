# VRTK Community Extras

This repository is a UPM package that contains:

- Zinnia-like components
- Tilia-like prefabs

[Zinnia](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Zinnia.Unity) and
[Tilia](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd?q=tilia) are UPM packages
from [ExtendRealityLtd](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd). They
contain a wealth of useful bits for building Unity applications,
especially if you're working in VR.

Here you will find a number of components and prefabs created by the
community built in the spirit of those projects.
